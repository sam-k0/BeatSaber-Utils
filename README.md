# BeatSaber-Utils
Several scripts that may be useful for beatsaber

Kinda not well documented but hey.

Most useful is probably fixBeatmap, which looks for abandoned files (cover, song) and renames them as stated in Info.dat
This exists because I broke my beatsaber maps by renaming files, and renaming 1000+ files by hand got really boring after the first 300
